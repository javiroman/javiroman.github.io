    Apache NiFi active contributor. Actually the contributions to this kind of huge
    projects is an ongoing process. My first code contribution was offically added 
    in the Apache NiFi 1.12.0 release, in the New Feature section. Here a screenshot
    of the release changelog (marked the particular contribution).

    <a href="https://incubator.apache.org/guides/ppmc.html">PPMC (Podling Project Management Committee)</a> for the Apache Myriad Incubator project.

    This project (right now retired) was a higly specializated project in the 
    context of Apache Mesos. According with the official description: "Apache 
    Myriad enables the co-existence of Apache Hadoop and Apache Mesos on the 
    same physical infrastructure. By running Hadoop YARN as a Mesos framework, 
    YARN applications and Mesos frameworks can run side-by-side, dynamically 
    sharing cluster resources."

    Note: The project is under huge modifications for migrating from the resource scheduler
    Apache Mesos to the Linux Software Foundation Kubernetes. The idea is to reboot 
    Apache Myriad with this key code refactoring.

    The Ben NanoNote (officially the NanoNote) was  a pocket computer using the 
    Linux-based OpenWrt operating system. An open-source hardware device developed 
    by Qi Hardware, it was called the world's smallest Linux laptop. This device
    was created by the team leaders of OpenMoko initiavite. My personal contrubution
    was the maintainer of Linux Kernel for the device, in particular the integration
    of in kernel tree WiFi driver.

    Openmoko was project to create a family of open source mobile phones, 
    including the hardware specification, the operating system (Openmoko Linux), 
    and actual smartphone development implementation like the Neo 1973 and 
    Neo FreeRunner. The whole project was sponsored by Openmoko Inc. I was a core
    developer with contributions around drivers related with the mobile vibrator 
    and then backlight (screen inteisity) driver. <a href="https://github.com/openmoko/openmoko-svn/blob/c618c442d32c1bb0d7b6f8f36205281bc7326ad4/src/target/kernel/patches/s3c2410-pwm.patch">Some contributions here</a>.

    Esware Linux was a linux distribution entirely created in Spain. To date 
    it has been the only linux distribution that was sold in El Corte Ingl√©s mall. 
    The distribution used as base a distribution based on RPM packages, later 
    it started using DEB packages. Esware Linux was very popular in the 
    Spanish Linux world. I was a founding partner of the company, and I was 
    in charge of the technical direction of the company (as well as the main 
    developer). 

    ESware Linux was company dedicated to facilitate development and encourage 
    the creation of GNU/Linux projects, but ESware Linux not only develops a 
    GNU/Linux Operating System, but also provides a global services structure 
    that allows companies, professionals and home users to make Linux possible.
    Digital Mood announced that has acquired 40 percent of ESware Linux through
    the subscription of the first capital increase of this Spanish technology 
    company dedicated to commercialization of Linux software and consulting and
    training on this operating system.
